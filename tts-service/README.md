# Local Speech Service

A small FastAPI service that does **all speech processing locally, on your
own machine** - no ElevenLabs, no Deepgram, no cloud speech API of any
kind. The Node voice agent calls it over plain HTTP on localhost (or
wherever you run it on your own network).

**Text-to-speech:**
- **Hindi** text is spoken by [Piper](https://github.com/OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl)
  using a native Hindi voice.
- **English** text is spoken by [MeloTTS](https://github.com/myshell-ai/MeloTTS)'s
  `EN_INDIA` speaker - English synthesized with an Indian accent.

`src/services/localTts.ts` on the Node side decides which language a given
sentence is in (checking for Devanagari script) and calls this service with
`{"text": "...", "language": "en" | "hi"}`, getting back a WAV file.

**Speech-to-text:**
- Caller audio is transcribed by a self-hosted [Whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper)
  model (via `faster-whisper`), which handles both English and Hindi and
  reports which one it detected.

Node buffers and segments caller audio itself (`src/utils/vad.ts` - a
simple energy-based voice-activity detector that replaced Deepgram's
hosted one) and, once an utterance finishes, sends the whole clip as WAV
bytes to `POST /transcribe` (`src/services/localStt.ts`), getting back
`{"text": "...", "language": "en" | "hi"}`.

## Setup

```bash
cd tts-service
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

# MeloTTS isn't on a requirements-friendly index; install from source and
# run its one-time data download.
pip install git+https://github.com/myshell-ai/MeloTTS.git
python -m unidic download
```

### Download the Hindi voice model

Piper voice models aren't bundled here (they're binary assets). Pick a
Hindi voice from the [Piper voices repo](https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/tree/main/hi/hi_IN)
- `pratham` (male) or `priyamvada` (female), both medium quality - and
download both files into `models/`:

```bash
mkdir -p models
curl -L -o models/hi_IN-pratham-medium.onnx \
  https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/resolve/main/hi/hi_IN/pratham/medium/hi_IN-pratham-medium.onnx
curl -L -o models/hi_IN-pratham-medium.onnx.json \
  https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/resolve/main/hi/hi_IN/pratham/medium/hi_IN-pratham-medium.onnx.json
```

To use `priyamvada` instead, swap the filenames above and set
`PIPER_HI_MODEL_PATH=models/hi_IN-priyamvada-medium.onnx` in your `.env`.

MeloTTS and the Whisper model (via `faster-whisper`) both download their
own checkpoints automatically (via Hugging Face) the first time the
service starts.

## Running

```bash
uvicorn server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001
```

Leave this running alongside `npm run dev` in the main project - the Node
server expects it at `LOCAL_SPEECH_SERVICE_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:8001`).

First startup will be slow (loading three models); after that, requests
are fast since everything stays warm in memory.

## Compute

All three models run on CPU. Piper is fast enough for real-time Hindi
synthesis; MeloTTS and Whisper are heavier and will noticeably lag a cloud
API's latency on CPU alone, especially the STT round trip (buffer the
utterance → send it → wait for Whisper to run). A GPU isn't required, but
if you have one, set `MELO_DEVICE=cuda` and `WHISPER_DEVICE=cuda` - both
drop render/transcribe time sharply with no quality loss.

`WHISPER_MODEL_SIZE` (default `small`) trades accuracy for speed: `base`
is faster but noticeably worse on Hindi; `medium` is more accurate but
slower on CPU. `WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE` defaults to `int8`, which is
meaningfully faster on CPU than `float32` for a small accuracy cost.

## Licensing note

Piper's actively-developed fork is GPL-3.0. That only matters if you ever
*redistribute* this service (or a product built on it) to others - running
it privately as your own backend, as this project does, isn't a
distribution event under GPL, so there's nothing to do here. If you do plan
to ship this service itself to customers, get your own legal read on that
first. MeloTTS and faster-whisper are both MIT-licensed.
